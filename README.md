## How to ditribute App in Ios Store
<details>
  <summary>ðŸ“¦ How to Publish React Native App to the iOS App Store</summary>

  Hereâ€™s a high-level step-by-step guide to release a React Native app to the iOS App Store:

  1. **Create an Apple Developer Account**
     - Sign up at [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com) ($99/year).

  2. **Configure Your App for Release**
     - Update `app.json` or `Info.plist` with proper `name`, `version`, `bundleIdentifier`, etc.
     - Use production-ready assets (icons, splash screens).
     - If using Expo: set `"ios": { "buildNumber": "1.0.0", "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourname.yourapp" }`.

  3. **Set Up Certificates and Profiles**
     - Use Xcode or [Apple Developer Console](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/) to create:
       - **App ID**
       - **Provisioning Profile**
       - **Distribution Certificate**

  4. **Build the iOS App**
     - **With Expo:**
       ```bash
       eas build --platform ios
       ```
       Make sure you're logged in to an Apple Developer account.
     - **Without Expo (Bare React Native):**
       ```bash
       cd ios
       pod install
       open YourApp.xcworkspace
       ```
       Then build the archive using **Xcode** â†’ **Product** â†’ **Archive**.

  5. **Test with TestFlight (optional but recommended)**
     - Upload the archive using **Xcode** or **Transporter**.
     - Set up internal/external testers in App Store Connect.

  6. **Submit for Review**
     - Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)
     - Fill in app details, upload screenshots, set pricing and availability.
     - Submit your build for review.

  7. **Wait for Approval**
     - Apple will review your app and usually respond within a few days.
     - Once approved, your app will be available on the App Store.
